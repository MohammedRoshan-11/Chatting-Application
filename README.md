Chat Application (Client-Server)

Overview

This is a simple chat application that allows two users to communicate with each other in real time using a client-server model. It uses Java's Socket class for networking, JFrame for GUI components, and DataOutputStream and DataInputStream for data communication between the client and server.

Features:

Real-time Messaging: Allows both the client and server to send and receive messages in real-time.

GUI Interface: A simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with Swing for sending and receiving messages.

Profile Section: Displays user profile information and status (e.g., "Active Now").

Message Formatting: Displays messages with timestamps and dynamic styling.

Connection: The client connects to the server through a local network address (127.0.0.1) and port (6001).
